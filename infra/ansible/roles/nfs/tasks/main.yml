# The following task is a fix to a 'possibly' bug in starting NFS service with systemd.
# In a new nfs-common package installation on Debian11, the service's path below was
# a symbolic link to /dev/null, which makes systemd mask the NFS service
# Resulting in a dead service that systemd can't unmask at all. Removing
# this symlink and relading the service fixes the issue.
# The weirdest thing is the error message that the 'mount' command was throwing
# a misleading and unrelated to this issue:
# >> Error mgs: mount: 10.10.50.22:/volume1/testâ€ƒ/data: can't find in /etc/fstab.
# Note: neither the 'masked: false' Ansible directive nor 'command: systemctl unmask ..' worked.
